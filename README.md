## What We Request

Please **keep this proxy hidden from your IT** as much as possible. I’m running low on domains, hosting platforms, and budget. Previous versions have already cost me a few hundred dollars.  

I **won’t add ads** for now to keep the proxy **fast and secure**, but I might reconsider if funds get really low.  

Willow is **built and maintained by me alone**, and it’s getting harder without a team. I’d love to **hire more people**. Please share this proxy with as many people as possible to help support it!
